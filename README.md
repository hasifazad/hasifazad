Hi there 👋 I'm Hasif Azad
I'm an autodidact full-stack web developer and trainer who loves diving deep into how things work — whether it's code, computers, or the world around us.

🚀 Building a side project — a Learning Management System (LMS).

🎯 Recently mentored TinkHer, one of Kerala’s largest women-only hackathons organized by TinkerHub.

🤖 I enjoy connecting hardware with software and have explored various microcontrollers.

🌱 I love to code and spend most of my free time exploring new concepts in computer science.

📚 Outside of tech, I enjoy reading about history, humans, and how the world works.

👨‍💻 Tech Stack
